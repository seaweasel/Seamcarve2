	 * In this method, you'll implement the dynamic programming algorithm that
	 * you learned on the first day of class to find the lowest cost seam from
	 * the top of the image to the bottom. BEFORE YOU START make sure you fully
	 * understand how the algorithm works and what it's doing. See the handout
	 * for some helpful resources and use hours/piazza to clarify conceptual
	 * blocks before you attempt to write code.
	 * 
	 * This method returns an array of ints that represents a seam. This size of
	 * this array is the height of the image. Each entry of the seam array
	 * corresponds to one row of the image. The data in each entry should be the
	 * x coordinate of the seam in this row. For example, given the below
	 * "image" where s is a seam pixel and - is a non-seam pixel
	 * 
	 * - s - - s - - - - s - - - - s -
	 * 
	 * 
	 * the following code will properly return a seam:
	 * 
	 * int[] currSeam = new int[4]; currSeam[0] = 1; currSeam[1] = 0;
	 * currSeam[2] = 1; currSeam[3] = 2; return currSeam;
	 * 
	 *
	 * @return the lowest cost seam of the current image
